once compiled, I used eclipse ide, but 'javac CSC546Ass1' should suffice

to use,

java CSC546Ass1 5  3  0.1 76654

where '5' is the number of samples
3 is number of computers and 0.1 is probability a computer will attempt to transmit.
and '76654' is the start seed.

the output will be the average number of time slots 
it took so k computers all successfully send 1 packet.

note the slots start at slot 0.  So for 1 computer with probability 1 of transmitting will 
give a result of 0 slots, since it will successfully transmit in the first slot.  This is consistent 
with question 6 of which I verified my equation with the simulator.

made a change from rigi
